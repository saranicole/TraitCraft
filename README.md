# TraitCraft

## A Console and PC Addon for Elder Scrolls Online

### What Does it Do for Me?

Tired of writing down which traits you need across which alts so that you can craft them on your main and research them on your alts?  This addon is for you!

Currently shows the unresearched traits on the research tab.

### Roadmap

* Autocraft option
* Possibly show traits on banked items (similar to TraitBuddy)

### Thanks, Credit, and Inspiration

I give credit to Baertram and the other developers ingeniousclown, katkat42, and Randactyl who developed [LibResearch](https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info517-LibResearch.html) and [Research Assistant](https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info111-ResearchAssistantFindyourresearchableitems.html), some code of which I used and modified.  When I get to the autocraft feature I will no doubt look at [Dolgubon's Lazy Writ Crafter](https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info1346-DolgubonsLazyWritCrafter.html) by Dolgubon as well.

Special thanks to [MaliBuuGaming](https://www.esoui.com/forums/member.php?u=83968) for the original ESO UI post that got me thinking about this problem in ESO, and for alpha testing some very unstable releases.
