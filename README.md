[size=+2]A Console and PC Addon for Elder Scrolls Online[/size]

[size=+2]What Does it Do for Me?[/size]

Tired of writing down which traits you need across which alts so that you can craft them on your main and research them on your alts?  This addon is for you!

[size=+2]Features[/size]

PC and Console: 

* Show any combination of researched, unresearched, and researching traits in the crafting research and creations tabs via icons specific to researching characters (which you specify).
* Autocraft next equipment needed for desired alts' research, with priority given to shorter research times
* Slash command "/tcstats" will give you a quick overview of research on actively researching characters

Console only: Shows researching statuses of actively researching characters on inventory/bank/guild bank/decon tooltips.

[size=+2]Thanks, Credit, and Inspiration[/size]

Many thanks to wolfstar for their time - with their permission I took the entire feature of inventory tooltips from TraitBuddy for use on console.  The inventory tooltip feature is only available on consoles to preserve compatibility with TraitBuddy on PC.

I give credit to Baertram and the other developers ingeniousclown, katkat42, and Randactyl who developed [LibResearch](https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info517-LibResearch.html) and [Research Assistant](https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info111-ResearchAssistantFindyourresearchableitems.html), some code of which I used and modified.  

Special thanks to [MaliBuuGaming](https://www.esoui.com/forums/member.php?u=83968) for the original ESO UI post that got me thinking about this problem in ESO, and for alpha testing some very unstable releases.
