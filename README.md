# TraitCraft

## A Console and PC Addon for Elder Scrolls Online

### What Does it Do for Me?

Tired of writing down which traits you need across which alts so that you can craft them on your main and research them on your alts?  This addon is for you!

Currently shows the unresearched traits on the research tab.

### Roadmap

* Autocraft option
* Possibly show traits on banked items (similar to TraitBuddy)

### How to Use
1. Log into your main crafter ( the one with the most traits researched already )
2. Install TraitCraft (or reset its saved variables from the "Manage My Addons" tab)
3. Select your crafters from the addon menu
4. Select your actively researching character(s) from the dropdown and select an icon for it - that icon will show up in the research tab of your selected crafters next to the trait they need
5. Click "Apply Settings" - note that settings do not automatically apply in this addon's menu
6. Log onto the actively researching character(s) - this can be quick, just log on and you don't have to do anything else
7. Log back onto the desired crafter
8. Open a crafting interaction
9. Open the Research view
10. See the icon(s) of the actively researching character(s) next to their needed traits - you will need to manually craft for now

### How it works

In order to operate within the limits of console addons, there is a setting that reduces the number of traits that this will scan - the "limit" setting.  This is intended for use with many characters that are brand new or have many traits they need to limit the memory requirements.  If this setting is turned off, the addon will scan one trait per research line (equipment or weapon type).  

This addon does not currently scan and store all needed traits for every crafting type and research line in order to conserve memory.  I will investigate ways to do this, but for now, seeing only one trait per research line is expected behavior.

This behavior may change as time goes on and I can observe how players are using this addon.

### Thanks, Credit, and Inspiration

I give credit to Baertram and the other developers ingeniousclown, katkat42, and Randactyl who developed [LibResearch](https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info517-LibResearch.html) and [Research Assistant](https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info111-ResearchAssistantFindyourresearchableitems.html), some code of which I used and modified.  When I get to the autocraft feature I will no doubt look at [Dolgubon's Lazy Writ Crafter](https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info1346-DolgubonsLazyWritCrafter.html) by Dolgubon as well.

Special thanks to [MaliBuuGaming](https://www.esoui.com/forums/member.php?u=83968) for the original ESO UI post that got me thinking about this problem in ESO, and for alpha testing some very unstable releases.
